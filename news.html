                <p>BMW M1 Homage (2008)</p>
                <p class="car-info">
                -Thirty years on from having its fingers burnt trying to make a supercar with the first M1, BMW showed off the M1 Homage at the 2008 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. This haute couture show for classic cars and concepts was the ideal place to pitch an updated M1, even if BMW didn’t bother releasing even the most basic details of its specification.
                As a result, the Homage was only every going to be a show car, but it did go on to influence the 2009 Vision EfficientDynamics Concept that ultimately resulted in the hybrid i8.

                <p class="car-info">
                    -Jaguar has a history of stealing motorshow limelight with its sportscars and the CX-75 was no different when the covers were pulled back at the 2010 Paris show.
                    Every inch the contemporary supercar, the low-slung CX-75 also predicted the trend towards hybrid power with its electric power, using a motor for each wheel and small gas turbine engines as range-extender motors. This gave a 200mph top speed and 31-mile battery range.
                    Developed with F1’s Williams Advanced Engineering, the CX-75 looked set to take Jaguar into contention with Ferrari and Lamborghini.
                    However, the economic climate counted against this move and the estimated price of £700,000 made it unviable. A starring role in the James Bond film Spectre was as close as the CX-75 got to being used on the public road, and then it was powered by a good old fashioned 542bhp 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine more usually found in a F-Type.</p>

                <p class="car-info">
                    -No stranger to fast cars, Chrysler wanted to up its stock and build a full-on supercar rather than a muscle car in 2004. The result was the ME 4-12 unveiled at Detroit that year with carbon-fibre chassis and the requisite hunkered-down styling of this breed of car. Power came from a turbocharged Mercedes V12 with 850bhp that was good enough for 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and a claimed 248mph top end.
                    Billed as the ‘most advanced Chrysler ever made’, the ME 4-12 was developed with production in mind, but the financial case didn’t add up. It was too expensive to build and the Chrysler name wasn’t reckoned to have enough clout with buyers of this sort of car, so the ME 4-12 stayed as a show pony.

                <p class="car-info">
                    BMW likes to offer high-performance versions of many of its models; however, not every car in the lineup gets the coveted M badge. Missing from the M lineup is an X7 M crossover, though the X7 M50i is no slouch. Those wanting more can turn to aftermarket tuner Dahler, which has taken the X7 and added a host of performance and visual 
                    upgrades to create a truly sinister SUV.
                    The twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 already makes 
                    523 horsepower (390 kilowatts) and 553 pound-feet (750 Newton-meters) of torque, though that
                     wasn’t enough for Dahler. The tuned version, called 
                     the Dark Shadow Edition, makes an impressive 621 hp (463 kW) and 612 lb-ft (830 Nm) of that
                      twisty stuff. That’s a sizable jump in power, though the tuner is preparing a more potent 
                      Stage 2 upgrade that will see the SUV deliver
                     637 hp (475 kW) and 627 lb-ft (850 Nm) of torque.

                        <p>2022 Subaru Outback </p>
                        <p class="car-info">
                        A Subaru Outback is just as natural parked by a million-dollar beach home in Connecticut as it is traversing 
                        a campsite in Mount Hood. Most owners, no matter where they live or how much they make, prefer
                            the Outback's practicality, comfort, and affordable cost over a rock-biting, trailblazing hell of a time. The Outback
                            Wilderness is the opposite. This is Subaru's
                            version of a Raptor—lifted and factory-kitted to tackle more abuse on tough terrain. We drove one near all 
                            those pretty Connecticut homes, and while the Wilderness
                            may seem like an appearance package, it's entirely purposeful.
                            The regular Outback sits 8.7 inches off the ground, which is more than 
                            many SUVs and full-size pickup trucks. The Wilderness raises its cladded body
                             to 9.5 inches, a tenth higher than a Tacoma TRD Pro. It won't bite off the biggest 
                             boulders, but its breakover and departure angles are about equal
                             to the Toyota's. And on the street, it looks mean.
